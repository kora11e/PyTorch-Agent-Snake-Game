<h1> PyTorch Agent Snake Solver </h1>

<h2> Overview </h2>

This project is a demonstration of the potential of artificial intelligence in playing and mastering video games. It leverages the power of PyTorch for the neural network and reinforcement learning components, combined with the Pygame library for game implementation and visualization. The result is an AI agent capable of playing the classic Snake game autonomously, learning and improving its performance through experience.

<h2> Motivation </h2>

The inspiration behind this project stems from my long-standing passion for video games and a keen interest in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. Video games have always fascinated me not only as a source of entertainment but also as complex systems that require strategic thinking, quick decision-making, and adaptability. With the rapid advancements in AI, I was curious to explore how these technologies can be applied to create intelligent agents capable of playing games.

Snake, being a simple yet challenging game, provides an ideal environment for experimenting with AI techniques. By developing this project, I aimed to delve deeper into reinforcement learning, understand its intricacies, and witness firsthand how an AI agent can evolve and improve its gameplay over time.

<h2> Features </h2>

1. AI Agent: Utilizes a deep Q-network (QNN) for decision making.
2. Training: The agent is trained using reinforcement learning principles, learning from its experiences in the game.
3. Game Environment: Built using Pygame, providing a visual representation of the game and the agent's actions.
4. Customizable Parameters: Various parameters such as learning rate, discount factor, and exploration rate can be tuned for optimal performance.
5. Real-time Visualization: Watch the AI play the game in real-time, showcasing its learning progress and strategy evolution.
